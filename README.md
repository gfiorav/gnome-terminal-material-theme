# Material Theme for the GNOME Terminal
This is a spiritual fork of https://github.com/stoeffel/material-iterm, but for the GNOME Terminal

## Requirements

- ruby
- bundler
- zlib
- gconf2

## Build

### Material light

```bash
make light
make install
make clean
```

### Material dark

```bash
make dark
make install
make clean
```

## Note

I couldn't get this to actually update my gnome terminal in Ubuntu 19.04, but there's reason for this to work on more vanilla gnome terminals. Good luck.
